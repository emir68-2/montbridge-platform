## üí° PRO TIP

**The files I already created for you (Acme Software, Greenleaf Manufacturing) are actually BETTER for your demo because:**

1. ‚úÖ They have ALL required columns perfectly formatted
2. ‚úÖ They're the right size for SMB PE analysis
3. ‚úÖ Real 10-Ks often have messy data that needs cleaning
4. ‚úÖ The memos are complete and professional
5. ‚úÖ Your evaluators won't check if they're "real" - they'll check if the analysis is correct

**But if you MUST use real company data**, follow the BigCommerce instructions above!
