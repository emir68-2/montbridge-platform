## üéì For Your University Evaluators

### Tell Them:

**About the Data:**
"We've created three realistic company datasets based on typical private equity acquisition targets. Acme Software Solutions represents a high-growth SaaS company with $4.9M revenue, while Greenleaf Manufacturing represents a sustainable packaging manufacturer with $8.7M revenue. The financial data and investment memos follow industry-standard formats used in real PE transactions."

**Why Not Real Public Company:**
"While we could use public company data from SEC EDGAR, we created proprietary datasets to:
1. Ensure data completeness (many 10-Ks have incomplete information)
2. Control for realistic SMB characteristics (most public companies are too large)
3. Include all necessary fields for comprehensive analysis
4. Demonstrate platform capabilities without confidentiality concerns"

**Data Quality:**
"The financial statements include 4 years of complete data with Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow metrics. The investment memos follow standard PE format with executive summary, financial analysis, market overview, risk factors, and investment thesis."
