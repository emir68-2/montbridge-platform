## 💰 Financial Modeling Capabilities

### 1. **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** ✅
**What it does:**
- Projects 5 years of future free cash flows
- Calculates terminal value
- Discounts to present value using WACC
- Produces enterprise value estimate

**Inputs Required:**
- Revenue (from your financial statements)
- EBITDA margin (calculated or provided)
- Growth rate (calculated from historical data)

**Outputs:**
- Year-by-year projected cash flows
- Discounted cash flows
- Terminal value
- Total enterprise value
- Detailed assumptions

**Example Output:**
```
Year 1 Cash Flow: $116,803 → Discounted: $104,289
Year 2 Cash Flow: $125,198 → Discounted: $99,807
Year 3 Cash Flow: $134,853 → Discounted: $95,986
Year 4 Cash Flow: $145,956 → Discounted: $92,757
Year 5 Cash Flow: $158,724 → Discounted: $90,064
Terminal Value: $1,712,546 → Discounted: $971,744
---
Total Enterprise Value: $1,454,648
```

### 2. **Comparable Company Analysis** ✅
**What it does:**
- Applies industry trading multiples
- Calculates enterprise value using EV/Revenue and EV/EBITDA
- Averages multiple approaches

**Industry Multiples Used:**
- EV/Revenue: 2.5x
- EV/EBITDA: 8.0x
- P/E: 15.0x
- P/B: 1.8x

**Example Calculation:**
```
Revenue: $1,216,700 × 2.5 = $3,041,750
EBITDA: $182,505 × 8.0 = $1,460,040
Average Enterprise Value: $2,250,895
```

### 3. **Precedent Transactions** ✅
**What it does:**
- Applies acquisition multiples (higher due to control premium)
- Reflects synergies and strategic value
- Provides upper-end valuation estimate

**Transaction Multiples Used:**
- EV/Revenue: 3.0x (20% premium over comps)
- EV/EBITDA: 10.0x (25% premium over comps)

**Example Calculation:**
```
Revenue: $1,216,700 × 3.0 = $3,650,100
EBITDA: $182,505 × 10.0 = $1,825,050
Average Enterprise Value: $2,737,575
```

### 4. **Sensitivity Analysis** ✅
**What it does:**
- Tests impact of changing key variables
- Shows valuation range under different scenarios
- Identifies most sensitive assumptions

**Variables Tested:**
- **Growth Rate**: -2% to +3% from base case
- **Discount Rate**: 8% to 18% (±6% from base)
- **EBITDA Margin**: 10% to 22% (±7% from base)

**Example Output:**
```
Growth Rate Sensitivity:
- At 13% growth: $1,454,648
- At 15% growth: $1,454,648 (base)
- At 18% growth: $1,454,648

Discount Rate Sensitivity:
- At 8% WACC: $2,551,033 (+75%)
- At 12% WACC: $1,454,648 (base)
- At 18% WACC: $874,440 (-40%)
```

## ⚠️ Risk Analysis Capabilities

### 1. **Inconsistency Detection** ✅
**Compares:**
- Financial statements vs. investment memo
- Revenue figures across documents
- Growth rates mentioned vs. calculated
- Management claims vs. actual data

**Example Flags:**
- "Revenue discrepancy: Financials show $1.2M but memo states $1.5M"
- "Growth rate differs: 15% in statements vs. 20% in presentation"

### 2. **Financial Risk Analysis** ✅
**Checks for:**
- High leverage (Debt-to-Equity > 2.0)
- Customer concentration (>30% from one customer)
- Negative cash flow
- Unsustainable growth (>50%)

**Example Risks:**
- "High customer concentration: 60% of revenue from top 3 customers"
- "Debt-to-equity ratio of 2.5 exceeds healthy threshold"

### 3. **Operational Risk Analysis** ✅
**Identifies from documents:**
- Management concerns
- Competitive threats
- Regulatory issues
- Operational challenges

**Example Risks:**
- "Dependency on key technical personnel mentioned"
- "Competitive market with larger players entering"

### 4. **Risk Categorization** ✅
**Three Severity Levels:**
- 🔴 **HIGH**: Immediate attention required, may affect valuation
- 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Should be addressed in due diligence
- 🟢 **LOW**: Monitor post-acquisition

### 5. **Risk Mitigation Recommendations** ✅
**Provides:**
- **Negotiation Points**: Price adjustments, earnouts
- **Deal Structure**: Warranties, indemnities, escrows
- **Due Diligence**: Additional verification needed
- **Post-Acquisition**: Monitoring requirements
