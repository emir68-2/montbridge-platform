RISK FACTORS

1. CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION (MEDIUM RISK)
While top 10 customers represent only 28% of revenue, loss of multiple key accounts could impact growth. The Company has strong relationships and high retention, mitigating this risk.

2. COMPETITIVE PRESSURE (MEDIUM RISK)
Large enterprise software vendors (Oracle, SAP, Microsoft) are increasingly targeting the SMB market. However, Acme's industry-specific features and superior service provide differentiation.

3. KEY PERSON DEPENDENCY (MEDIUM RISK)
The Company is heavily dependent on the founding team, particularly the CEO and CTO. Management has agreed to 3-year employment contracts with retention bonuses.

4. TECHNOLOGY RISK (LOW RISK)
Rapid changes in technology could require significant R&D investment. The Company maintains modern tech stack and allocates 15% of revenue to R&D.

5. ECONOMIC SENSITIVITY (LOW RISK)
SMB software spending may decline in economic downturn. However, ERP systems are mission-critical and have historically shown resilience.

6. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE (LOW RISK)
Data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) require ongoing compliance. The Company maintains SOC 2 Type II certification and has dedicated compliance resources.
