RISK FACTORS

1. BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION RISK (HIGH)
The Company has undergone significant restructuring with the sale of its Professional Segment. Post-divestiture performance may differ from pro forma estimates. Integration and transition risks are elevated during this period.

2. REVENUE DECLINE (HIGH)
Pro forma revenue of $125M represents a 60% decline from historical $313M. The remaining business must demonstrate sustainable growth to justify valuation.

3. LOW OPERATING MARGINS (HIGH)
Operating margin of only 2.5% provides limited buffer for operational challenges or market downturns. Cost structure needs improvement to achieve industry-standard margins.

4. DEBT AND LEVERAGE (MEDIUM - IMPROVING)
While debt was reduced through the sale proceeds, the Company still carries debt obligations. Interest expense of $1.1M annually impacts profitability.

5. INDUSTRY CYCLICALITY (MEDIUM)
Staffing industry is cyclical and sensitive to economic conditions. Economic downturn could significantly impact demand for staffing services.

6. COMPETITIVE MARKET (MEDIUM)
Staffing industry is highly competitive with numerous national and regional players. Pricing pressure and talent acquisition challenges are ongoing concerns.

7. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IMPACT (MEDIUM)
The pro forma statements reflect assumptions about the separation. Actual results may differ due to:
- Transition services agreements
- Shared services separation
- Customer and employee retention
- Operational disruptions

8. ONE-TIME GAIN DISTORTION (LOW)
The $17.7M gain on sale significantly inflates 2023 net income. Normalized earnings are much lower, which must be considered in valuation.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

VALUATION CONSIDERATIONS

Challenges for Valuation:
- Recent major divestiture creates uncertainty
- Historical performance shows losses
- Low operating margins
- Pro forma results include one-time gain
- Limited growth visibility

Positive Factors:
- Improved gross margins post-divestiture
- Debt reduction improves financial flexibility
- Focus on core business may improve efficiency
- Staffing industry has stable demand

Preliminary Assessment:
Given the operational challenges and recent transformation, valuation should focus on:
- Normalized EBITDA (excluding gain on sale): ~$4-5M
- Industry multiples for staffing: 4-6x EBITDA
- Implied enterprise value: $16-30M
- Significant discount warranted for transformation risk

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATION

PROCEED WITH CAUTION - ENHANCED DUE DILIGENCE REQUIRED

Strengths:
- Real company with public financial disclosure
- Recent debt reduction improves balance sheet
- Improved gross margins post-divestiture
- Staffing industry has stable long-term demand

Concerns:
- Significant business transformation in progress
- Historical operating losses
- Very low operating margins (2.5%)
- Revenue decline of 60% post-divestiture
- Limited visibility into future performance

Required Due Diligence:
1. Detailed analysis of remaining business operations
2. Customer retention post-divestiture
3. Management team assessment and retention
4. Competitive positioning in core markets
5. Path to improved operating margins
6. Growth strategy and capital requirements
7. Working capital and cash flow sustainability

Recommendation:
This represents a turnaround/transformation opportunity rather than a stable growth investment. Suitable for investors with:
- Operational expertise in staffing industry
- Ability to drive margin improvement
- Tolerance for execution risk
- Longer investment horizon

Valuation should reflect elevated risk profile with appropriate discount to comparable transactions.
