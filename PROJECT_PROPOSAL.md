## AI/ML INTEGRATION - WHERE & HOW

### 1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
**Technology:** spaCy, transformers library  
**Purpose:** Extract key information from investment memos and documents

**AI Applications:**
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identify companies, people, dates, financial figures
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Detect positive/negative tone in management communications
- **Keyword Extraction:** Find risk-related terms (bankruptcy, lawsuit, competition, etc.)
- **Information Extraction:** Pull financial metrics mentioned in text

**Example:**
```
Input Text: "Revenue grew 25% to $5.2 million in 2023"
AI Extraction: 
  - Metric: Revenue
  - Value: $5,200,000
  - Year: 2023
  - Growth: 25%
```

### 2. Inconsistency Detection
**Technology:** Rule-based + ML pattern matching  
**Purpose:** Compare data across different sources

**AI Applications:**
- Cross-reference financial figures in memo vs. spreadsheets
- Flag discrepancies >10%
- Detect contradictory narratives
- Identify missing or suspicious data

**Example:**
```
Financial Statement: Revenue = $5.2M
Investment Memo: "Revenue exceeded $6M"
AI Detection: INCONSISTENCY - 15% difference flagged as HIGH RISK
```

### 3. Risk Scoring Algorithm
**Technology:** Weighted scoring model with ML classification  
**Purpose:** Quantify overall risk profile

**AI Applications:**
- Analyze 20+ risk factors
- Weight by historical default/failure rates
- Calculate composite risk score (0-100)
- Classify investment opportunity (Low/Medium/High risk)

**Example:**
```
Risk Factors Detected:
- Customer concentration: 60% → Weight: HIGH → Score: +15
- Debt-to-equity: 0.2 → Weight: LOW → Score: +2
- Negative cash flow: No → Weight: N/A → Score: 0
Total Risk Score: 45/100 (MODERATE)
```

### 4. Predictive Financial Projections
**Technology:** Time series analysis, regression models  
**Purpose:** Project future cash flows for DCF

**AI Applications:**
- Analyze historical growth patterns
- Detect seasonality and trends
- Adjust for outliers
- Generate realistic forward projections
