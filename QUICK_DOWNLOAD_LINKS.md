## üí° Important Notes

### About the Numbers:
- BigCommerce numbers are in **dollars** (not thousands)
- Revenue = $329,400,000 means $329.4 million
- Your platform will handle this correctly

### About Negative Numbers:
- Many growth companies show **losses** (negative net income)
- This is NORMAL for high-growth tech companies
- Your DCF will use EBITDA instead
- Platform handles this correctly

### About EBITDA:
- If 10-K doesn't show EBITDA directly
- Platform will calculate: Operating Income + Depreciation
- OR use Operating Income as proxy
