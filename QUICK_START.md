# üöÄ QUICK START GUIDE

## Your Platform is NOW RUNNING!

### ‚úÖ What's Active:
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5001/api ‚úì
- **Frontend UI**: file:///Users/emir/cursor practice/index.html ‚úì

### üì§ How to Upload & Analyze Files:

#### Option 1: Use the Sample Data (RECOMMENDED FOR TESTING)
1. Click on "Upload & Analyze" tab in the browser
2. Click the upload area or drag & drop files
3. Upload these sample files:
   - `sample_data/sample_financials.csv`
   - `sample_data/sample_investment_memo.txt`
4. Click "üöÄ Run Complete Analysis"
5. Wait 5-10 seconds for processing
6. View results in Dashboard, Valuation, and Risks tabs

#### Option 2: Upload Your Own Financial Statements
1. Prepare files in these formats:
   - **Excel/CSV**: Financial statements with columns like:
     - Year, Revenue, EBITDA, Net Income, Total Assets, Total Debt, Equity, Growth Rate
   - **PDF/DOCX/TXT**: Investment memos, management reports, etc.

2. Upload through the interface
3. Click "Run Complete Analysis"

### üí∞ What You'll Get:

#### 1. **DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) Valuation**
- 5-year projected cash flows
- Terminal value calculation
- Discounted present value
- **Example**: If revenue is $1.2M with 15% growth ‚Üí DCF = ~$1.2M enterprise value

#### 2. **Comparable Company Analysis**
- Industry multiples applied:
  - EV/Revenue: 2.5x
  - EV/EBITDA: 8.0x
- **Example**: Revenue $1.2M √ó 2.5 = $3M; EBITDA $180K √ó 8 = $1.44M ‚Üí Average = $2.2M

#### 3. **Precedent Transactions**
- Acquisition multiples (with control premium):
  - EV/Revenue: 3.0x
  - EV/EBITDA: 10.0x
- **Example**: Revenue $1.2M √ó 3 = $3.6M; EBITDA $180K √ó 10 = $1.8M ‚Üí Average = $2.7M

#### 4. **Sensitivity Analysis**
- Tests different scenarios:
  - Growth rate: -2% to +3%
  - Discount rate: 8% to 18%
  - EBITDA margin: 10% to 22%
- Shows impact on valuation range

#### 5. **Risk Assessment**
- High/Medium/Low risk categorization
- Inconsistency detection
- Mitigation recommendations

### üîç What the Platform Analyzes:

From your **Consolidated Financial Statements**, it extracts:
- Revenue (latest year)
- EBITDA or Net Income
- Growth rate (year-over-year change)
- Debt levels
- Asset values

Then it:
1. Projects 5 years of future cash flows
2. Calculates terminal value
3. Discounts to present value
4. Applies industry multiples
5. Generates valuation range

### üêõ Troubleshooting:

**If DCF doesn't show:**
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify backend is running: `curl http://localhost:5001/api/health`
3. Make sure your CSV has these columns:
   - **Revenue** (or Sales)
   - **EBITDA** (or Net Income)
   - Optionally: **Growth Rate**

**If file upload fails:**
1. Check file size < 16MB
2. Verify file format (CSV, XLSX, PDF, DOCX, TXT)
3. Look at browser console for error messages

### üìä Sample Data Expectations:

Using `sample_financials.csv`:
- **Revenue 2023**: $1,216,700
- **EBITDA**: $182,505 (15% margin)
- **Growth Rate**: 15%

**Expected Results:**
- **DCF**: ~$1.2M (based on projected cash flows)
- **Comps**: ~$2.2M (based on 2.5x revenue or 8x EBITDA)
- **Precedent**: ~$2.7M (based on 3x revenue or 10x EBITDA)
- **Range**: $1.2M - $2.7M

### üéì For Your University Demo:

This platform demonstrates:
1. ‚úÖ Data ingestion (structured & unstructured)
2. ‚úÖ Financial modeling (DCF, Comps, Precedent)
3. ‚úÖ Sensitivity analysis (multiple scenarios)
4. ‚úÖ Risk assessment (AI-powered)
5. ‚úÖ Professional UI (charts & visualizations)
